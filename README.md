# WaitTimes Scraper
Application used to capture and store wait times for Disney World and Universal Studios rides.

## Wait Times Project Requirements

### Backlog:

- (5) ~~Retrieve every rides wait times once per minute.~~
- Develop a strategy for purging wait times outside operating hours.
- (2) ~~Store every rides timestamp and wait time into MongoDB.~~
- Create API for retrieval of stored results.
- Display each rides wait time in their own graph.
- Display EVERY rides wait time in one graph.
- Allow users to specify timeframe (predefined).
- Allow wait times to be compared.
- Make a page that has 12 little 40x40 divs to represent each month of the year. Color code each one to its relative busyness on a green-yellow-red scale.
- Duplicate each little 40x40 div to show EVERY rides yearly busyness. Almost like a 12x(# of rides) table.


Nice-to-haves:
- Use the wait times to create hotspots on a Google Map.
- Animate hotspots, showing wait time changes throughout the day.
